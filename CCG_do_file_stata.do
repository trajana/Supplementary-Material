*PURPOSE: Determine whether there are significant differences in the suggested 
*decisions made in the baseline group based on the different orders in which the 
*games were played (non-parametric alternative to ANOVA)

*2. TEST: Kruskal-Wallis-Test 

*PURPOSE: Determine whether there are significant differences in the suggested 
*decisions made in the treatment group based on the different orders in which

*Tests for Hypothesis 1: The IOS11 score is expected to be higher in the 
*treatment group, indicating greater social closeness among friends compared to 
*strangers.


*1. TEST: Calculate mean values and create histogramm

*PURPOSE: See if the values differ

mean ios1 if treatment == 1
mean ios1 if treatment == 0
histogram ios1, by(treatment) discrete freq

*FIRST INTERPRETATION: Baseline: 2.95 Treatment:6.03


*2. TEST: Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney-Test / Ranksum-Test

*PURPOSE: Test whether friends actually feel socially closer than strangers. 
*This is also a manipultion check. (non-parametric alternative to t-test)

ranksum ios1, by(treatment)

*FIRST INTERPRETATION: p-value of 0.0000 is smaller than 0.05, so there is a 
*significant difference. The z-value (-5.059) indicates a higher IOS score in 
*the treatment group, which supports H1. The manipulation has worked.

*3. TEST: Quantile Regression

*PURPOSE: A non-parametric robustness check for the Mann-Whitney-Test. It
*directly handles the continuous nature of your IOS score while allowing for the
*inclusion of covariates such as gender and age. It does not require the strict
*assumptions of linear regression (e.g., normality of errors) and thus aligns 
*more closely with the spirit of non-parametric methods.

qreg ios1 treatment gender age

*FIRST INTERPRETATION: The results show that being in the treatment group has a 
*statistically significant positive effect on the median IOS score, supporting 
*the idea that individuals in the treatment group feel closer (higher IOS score)
*than those in the baseline group. Neither gender nor age significantly affects 
*the median IOS score, suggesting that the treatment effect is robust even when 
*accounting for these factors. This result provides a non-parametric robustness 
*check that aligns with the findings from the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test.


*==============================================================================*

*Tests for Hypothesis 2: Coordination rates in the suggested decisions will be 
*higher in the treatment condition compared to the baseline condition.


*1. TEST: Contingency table 

*PURPOSE: See the frequencies of decisions for all 8 games devides by baseline 
*vs. treatment and also devided by subgroup. The goal is to  get a feeling for 
*the data and see whether there are noticalble differences between the baseline 
*and the treatment group

*FIRST INTERPRETATION: There is only one significant result: Pie 4. This p-value 
*is less than 0.05, indicating that there is a statistically significant 
*difference in the decisions for Pie 4 between the baseline (strangers) and 
*treatment (friends) groups within subgroup #. Specifically, participants in the 
*treatment group (friends) were more likely to choose Decision 2 (10,1), while

*Decision 1 (1,10).

*in both the treatment (coefficient = 1.157, p < 0.01) and baseline group (
*coefficient = 1.119, p < 0.01). None of the control variables (position, order, 
*age) are significant in either group. However, gender is a significant 
*pre-dictor in the treatment group (coefficient = 0.557, p < 0.05) but not in 
*the baseline group. 

*==============================================================================*

*Additional Analysis

*Calculate the mean of final_payoff_euro for the baseline group (treatment == 0)
mean final_payoff_euro if treatment == 0

*Calculate the mean of final_payoff_euro for the treatment group (treatment == 1)
mean final_payoff_euro if treatment == 1

*Perform a ranksum test to check if there are significant differences between 
*the two groups
ranksum final_payoff_euro, by(treatment)
